Problem description - To count number of times, various elements are occuring inside of a given array of elements.
Practical application - In a data-set,if we are to reduce the size of data-set, we can do so by removing recurring elements in 
the data-set.This would reduce the time taken to process data,and results can be achieved by just processing unique data-elements
in the set.

The program is divided into 4 functions apart from the main function.
 Namely the     
    1.array_sort() function.
    2.count_array() function.
    3.unique_element() function.
    4.print() function.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 1. array_sort() function : sorts the array in ascending order, by using bubble-sort algorithm.

 2. count_array() function : takes the sorted array as an argument, and creates an array pass[], which stores the number of times unique
elements are occuring in the sorted array.

 3. unique_element() function : takes the sorted array as an argument , and creates an array of unique elements , in the ascending order.

 4. print() function: takes array of unique elements unique[] and the counter array pass[], and the prints index-wise the number of times
 each elements occur in the array.
